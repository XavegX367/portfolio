Once there are enough people that are interested in the app I want to introduce a subscription model. I also want to convert the PWA to a native app that could be downloaded from the AppStore and PlayStore, this could be done by using Capacitor. At the moment I have a working prototype which is open to test for anyone who is interested.",

I also grew my knowledge of TypeScript and the connection between frontend and backend with Laravel Passport.

Since my brother works in shifts I immediately thought of some kind of switch because another shift starts when his one ends and vice versa. That's why I decided to add arrow on both endings of the 'S' which makes it look like a continuous loop/switch. I then started with the design of the app, I did this in Figma. I wanted to build a clean UI which made it instantly clear what the user could do. I am a huge fan of dark mode and the cleanness of Apple's designs, so I decided to use pill buttons in a Material UI look. I really like the way blue looks on a dark background, so I decided to use that as the main color which also comes back in the logo.",

Upon entering the app, you immediately have a clear user interface (UI). It's not too busy, and you can easily see where you are in the app through the navigation menu at the bottom. Creating a new workout for yourself is simple and fast. After giving it a name, you can choose exercises to include in your workout. I might suggest adding an option to include a custom exercise with a description. Once again, compliments for the clear UI due to the well-thought-out layout, as well as the buttons with text or images for adding or removing items. If you're unsure about something, there's an information button about each exercise. In that information, it might be helpful to add images or a video of the exercise, so users have a visual reference and can perform the exercise correctly. Finally, something often crucial in fitness exercises is a built-in timer, so you don't have to exit the app to set a timer for each exercise. It would be nice if there's an option in the future to input the weight or increase the reps, allowing users to track their progress. Overall, it's a very handy and fast app for creating fitness workouts and keeping track of and saving them."
