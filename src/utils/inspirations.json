        "description": "It's a super interactive website with a lot of effects, and I probably haven't even seen half of the animations myself, but the following things stand out to me: The mouse tracker using dark colors is a design aspect that really appeals to me. Additionally, the website uses nice animations on hovers and scrolling. Furthermore, cool extra graphics like those 'pluses' have been added."

I also think the dark colors with the purple on top look great. Additionally, some hovers have a cool effect where the text moves up and disappears, then reappears in purple."
